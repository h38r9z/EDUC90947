EDUC90947 Mathematics: Building teacher capacity 
Assessment Task 1/2024 
‘Big data’ interpretation 
Due: 25 Aug 2024 (Sun) 11.59pm 
(2500 words max)
As a teacher / educator of mathematics, part of   your   building your teacher   capacity   is   associated with   being literate   in   interpreting relevant ‘big data’ presentations which had been created by yourself, your school,   or others, with   the   potential   for   informing pedagogical development and improvement.
In this assessment task, you are to nominate   any   one topic   we   have   discussed   (or   will discuss) in the weekly workshops, select any one   set   of ‘big data’   (e.g.   school NAPLAN data, TIMSS/PISA data, others’ research data which   are   publicly   available,   etc), where   n   is at   least   150 each, explain and   interpret them   in context,   and   present   a recommendation which is strategic and   meaningful to the   average Australian mathematics classroom.
The focus of your recommendation not only needs   to   take   into   account   the   current   state of school mathematics education in Australia   (e.g. out-of-field   teachers   of mathematics,   migrant students, lack of 代 写EDUC90947 Mathematics: Building teacher capacity Assessment Task 1/2024

It   is expected that   relevant   research   literature   is   referred to to   lend support to any   argument or assertion made   in your writing.
